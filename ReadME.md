# Hello, Understood!

This is my submission for the calendar coding challenge.

## Notes

* Users can cycle forward and backward through different months. The calendar accounts for leap years. 

* I've used only a bare HTML tempalate and populated the rest of the DOM with vanilla JS DOM manipulation.

* I prioritized functionality so styling was kept to a minimum. My next steps would be to add the coloring and button icons from the spec.

* I've left comments in the JS to detail the functionality and note where I'd make improvements in another iteration. I believe I could make the code DRY-er, but overall I'm happy with how it came together within the time allotted.

## Thanks for the opportunity!
